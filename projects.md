## [Fortblox](/fortblox)
A multiplayer voxel styled arena shooter, featuring fast paced gunplay. Environment construction and destruction. This side-project was built during my time at university with a co-collaborator. In approximately two years worth of free-time we built the engine and the game from the ground up with. OpenGL, C++

## [Procedural Cave Modelling and Rendering](/cave)
I developed a guided procedural cave-like level generation system for the final project of my university degree. As part of the project I implemented a level editor alongside a very simple proof-of-concept treasure-hunt game. The procedural mesh generation utilises a GPU accelerated implementation of the Marching Cubes algorithm. Direct3D 10, C++

## [Seasonal Snowglobe](/snowglobe)
A university project assignment in which I built a virtual changing-seasons snow globe demonstrating various graphics effects implemented using the OpenGL 3.0 core profile.
